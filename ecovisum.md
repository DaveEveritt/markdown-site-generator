## Tools to minimise the costs of energy and water usage

- reduce your environmental impact
- decrease your financial costs
- become accountable and transparent

## Making sense of energy data 

Our data analysis service processes your data to output just the technical information you need, summarised in various forms:

- at-a-glance hourly monitoring
- in-depth graphs to identify anomalies
- visual reports to share with stakeholders

# The problem

![Image of people using energy unthinkingly]()

> Energy and its management is famously invisible to end users [REF_LINK](#)

Energy efficiency is theoretically easy, but in practice it’s a huge challenge to monitor and optimise energy performance across large numbers of buildings in one location.

## Effective energy monitoring

A large building portfolio sees regular usage changes, and energy systems need ongoing maintenance and adaptation to keep them operating efficiently. Vigilance is required to:

- maintain the energy infrastructure
- plan suitable investments and interventions
- respond effectively to faults as they arise
- keep building users up-to-date

Organisations have increasing access to good quality energy and water usage data from their buildings, so it is now becoming easier to:

- monitor buildings continually
- identify energy usage issues
- prepare suitable interventions

However, the **volume of data** generated can be **overwhelming** and data management systems are often costly and overly complex, being designed primarily for technical users.

# Our solution

![Composite image of software? Or people using it!]()

> If building users change their behaviour, they need a visible indicator of their impact on energy costs to maintain motivation

We think energy management should be a distributed task with energy managers situated within a network of stakeholders.

We aim to allow information extracted from energy data to penetrate as deeply into that network as possible.

This means the communication of data in usable forms, enabling  stakeholders to take advantage of the data in creative ways.

## A new approach to energy management

Our dashboard provides a user-friendly ‘single source of truth’ that builds on your organisation’s raw data. This facilitates dialogue between:

- the overview of expert energy managers
- building users with valuable local knowledge

With the growing availability of excellent data, we have been able to redesign energy management information systems from the ground up, to meet these new demands:

- highlighting critical information for energy management
- presenting continual updates from automatically-extracted data
- on-demand energy management information in a usable form

Very simply, we make sure the right information is made available to the right people at the right time.

The rest is up to you.

# Energy management for experts

![Image of energy manager using software]()

> Our systems offer rapid monitoring of energy usage (electricity, gas, water) with details that increase at a click

In one online location you have:

 - simple summary reports
 - if nothing changed, you don't need to know
 - only focus on the interesting data
 - drill down to see the detail
 - no-fuss interface
 - easily sharable

# Energy information for non-technical stakeholders

![Image of people viewing software on a big screen and mobile]()

> How can it be used for communication?

- Publishable regularly-updated league tables
- User-friendly ‘smiley face’ analytics
- Enable buildings to self-monitor
- Display your data to a wider audience
- Keep users engaged
- Enable energy-saving competitions
- Encourage continuous improvement

# How we work

> since 2007 we have developed the ideas that underpin our approach—our product is now mature and robust enough to offer as a service.

The perfect system is effective, fast and cheap. However, in reality two of the three key areas will receive more focus than the other:

- quality
- affordability
- speed

Our system is **very affordable** yet of **high quality**, because we **slow down** the development process so that quality and affordability have the highest priority. Our methods are to:

- **evolve software** continuously, but gradually and carefully
- **recognise** that energy management sits within complex systems
- **make room** for effective ideas by shedding ineffective ones
- **engage users** in development by making feedback a priority

We are open to systematic experimentation, while guarding against complication.

This is how we achieve and deliver **high quality** at a **low cost**.

# Case studies

> Our system has been in use while evolving since 2007. Here are details from some of our users

## The National Union of Students and the ‘Energy Dashboard’

![NUS dashboard image]()

Run alongside the ‘Student Switch-Off’ campaign (SSO), EcoVisum worked with the NUS to offer universities and student residence providers (across the UK and the EU) integration of intra-hall energy-saving competitions as part of their energy-awareness campaigns. These were displayed as an online ‘leaderboard’ with the highest savers at the top.

Overall, there was a measurable and significant difference of 12% in energy saving between organisations using EcoVsum’s ‘Energy Dashboard’ and those who participated in SSO but who opted out of the software.

From a single online software service, the dashboard is available from mobile, through laptop and desktop computers, to large display screens and ‘widgets’ that can be added to websites, etc.

## Stadt Nürnberg and EDI-Net

![EDI-Net Nürnberg image]()

Under EDI-Net, Nürnberg maintains 34 buildings across four locations, with data displayed at increasing levels of detail on demand, from ‘smiley faces’ to detailed graphs.

By using our software, Nürnberg has been able to quantify the resulting savings, with a marked difference of XX%, equating to XXXtonnes of CO2 ???

Together with nine other organisations, including the Nottingham NHS, the city is committed to ongoing use of EDI-Net to maintain both awareness of and ease of use in monitoring energy use across a complex array of building and users under their management.
