      <h2>MAKING ENERGY DATA USABLE</h2>

      <p>Increasingly organisations have access to good quality energy and water usage data from buildings. These data represent an underused resource.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Technical aspects - energy management for experts</li>
        <li>Share information with non-technical people</li>
      </ul>

      <p>ECOVISUM is a Leicester-based company committed to helping people and organisations reduce their environmental impact through better management of their energy.</p>

      <p>We provide a range of services, specializing in engaging people via energy dashboards and creative visualisations. Most recently we have worked with National Union of Students on their Student Switch-off Campaign.</p>
