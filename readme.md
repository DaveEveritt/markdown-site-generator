# Website for Ecovisum

A rough content plan for the new Ecovisum website, built as a static single page from Markdown files.

## TO DO

- [ ] do mobile menu
- [ ] make design as a skin
- [ ] refactor styles as a neutral wireframe
- [ ] concatenate and minify .js files
- [x] map through an object storing the markdown file paths and HTML destinations
- [x] make Markdown converter generic
- [x] rewrite content (this is a straight copy)
- [x] decide on whether we need a contact form (not yet)
